This is the Simple Direct\-Media Layer, a general A\-P\-I that provides low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3\-D hardware via Open\-G\-L, and 2\-D framebuffer across multiple platforms.

S\-D\-L is written in C, but works with C++ natively, and has bindings to several other languages, including Ada, C\#, Eiffel, Erlang, Euphoria, Guile, Haskell, Java, Lisp, Lua, M\-L, Objective C, Pascal, Perl, P\-H\-P, Pike, Pliant, Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk.

This library is distributed under the zlib license, which can be found in the file \char`\"{}\-C\-O\-P\-Y\-I\-N\-G\char`\"{}. This license allows you to use S\-D\-L freely for any purpose as long as you retain the copyright notice.

The best way to learn how to use S\-D\-L is to check out the header files in the \char`\"{}include\char`\"{} subdirectory and the programs in the \char`\"{}test\char`\"{} subdirectory. The header files and test programs are well commented and always up to date. More documentation and F\-A\-Qs are available online at\-: \href{http://wiki.libsdl.org/}{\tt http\-://wiki.\-libsdl.\-org/}

If you need help with the library, or just want to discuss S\-D\-L related issues, you can join the developers mailing list\-: \href{http://www.libsdl.org/mailing-list.php}{\tt http\-://www.\-libsdl.\-org/mailing-\/list.\-php}
